In "The Eurogame as Heterotopia," Wilson argues that the abstractness , or flexibility of theme, present in modern Eurogames allows players and critics to effectively reinterpret their play experience in ways that were maybe unintended by the author.

What does Will say with regard to problematic themes in Eurogames

"a Wired article reports that an economics professor uses the game 'to teach his four children how free markets work'7 and the Wall Street Journal reported on how Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are drawn to the game because playing it is 'like running a start-up.'8 Clearly this game—despite its 'lack of strong setting or theme'—is encountered as meaning something, something specifically relevant to the players’ real lives in a thematic way."

These examples are not thematic, they are procedural.
Catan doesn’t model *themes* of these two domains, it models the actions and interactions of participants in similar real-world systems.
The meaning of Catan is not situated in either the theme or the material affordances provided by the rules or mechanics.
Instead, it is formed through what Frasca calls playformance.

Catan is about what players of Catan do.
While this may be informed by their understanding of the theme, and is constrained within a mechanical system, neither aspect is the sole arbiter of what Catan means.

First, what are the material aspects of Settlers of Catan (and First Nations)
  * What kind of purely material interpretation might we draw

Second, what are the thematic aspects of Settlers
  *  Covered pretty well in Wilson and 
Finally, how is Catan played? (This blog post)
  * How do players interact?
  * And how does this form meaning?
