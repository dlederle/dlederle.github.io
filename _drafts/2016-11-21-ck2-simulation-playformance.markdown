title: *Crusader Kings II*, Simulation and Play
layout: post

CK2 Simulates:
- inheritance
- death
- religious power/affinity
- military (but low fidelity compared to other tactics games
- vassal/liege power relations

It's a very rich simulation, whcih skirts the line between 4x and RPG

Critically though, the computational processes are divorced from the interaction processes.
The experience of *playing* CK2 is primarily one of sorting through various menus, looking for a wife with the genius trait.
(Incidentally, that's how I met my fiance!)
Most of the experience is trying to understand as much of the modeled world as possible, gathering info ino order to manipulate the constantly running simulation.
