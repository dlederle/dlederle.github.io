There is a veritable explosion of games using procedural content generation (or PCG).

I believe that interpretation of these games is still an open challenge for the game studies community.

Rhetorically: infinity/exploration/vastness

If something is infinitely boring what is the point; similarly if the generator isn't changing the player experience in some way why should we care as critics?
It becomes just another way to do data compression.
(Jon Blow on compression, Compton's infinite bowls of oatmeal problem)

Imbroglio (tiny tiny "world"), but massive space to explore.

The central question is "does this generator reward sustained engagement?"

First, understand what function the generator is performing for the designer (Gillian, CHI paper 201X)
 - Seriously not all PCG is interesting, some is just useful

Second, understand its connection point into the rest of the experience (with those three categories)

Third, investigate tellability
  - Not necessarily actually being "told",  but what is the potential tellability.
    - Very tough to do, not sure how to procede here

Fourth, if it does all of the above its probably worth engaging with the generator itself
  - Breadth, typicality, novelty, consistency, etc
  - black box probing/theory crafting/software studies
    - Kazemi spelunky generator, Pagnutti rogue analysis, Passage work




There are several ways a generator can tie into the larger game experience to reward sustained engagement:

- Integration with the fiction: Perhaps as a dynamic or generative narrative system (Facade, Icebound, more??)

- Integration with the game system: Levels, mechanics, items
  - Most succesful so far (Rogue etc, spelunky)

- Integration with teh visual art: procedural graphics
  - Beautiful (strangethink, others??)
  - Procedural graphics restores a sense of aura to visual art.
Although it can be infinitely reproduced, there is a sense of wonder, uniqueness and discovery when you see just the right seed
