Years ago my younger brother acquired a curious little board game at a thrift shop somewhere.
Perusing the rules it looked like a terrible election themed Monopoly.
It sat unplayed for years at my parents house.
Each time we wanted to play a game, it was always decided that if we wanted the Monopoly experience we prefered it with the childhood nostalgia of *Star Wars* Monopoly.
Eventually my parents were tired of having it take up shelf space and threatened to toss it out so I "rescued" it.
Now it sat unplayed on *my* shelves.
I've told myself I should write something about it, but haven't ever worked up the energy for what I'm guessing will be rather un-fun.
However, with the impending election I was motivated enough to dust if off and try to play through it.
This post is primarily notes and impressions of what the experience of playing the game was like.
