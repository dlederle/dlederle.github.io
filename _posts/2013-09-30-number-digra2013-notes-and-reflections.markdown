(This post was supposed to be written a month ago, immediately after I got home from Atlanta, but life intervened.
Moving is stressful.)

This year I attended [DiGRA](http://dm.lmc.gatech.edu/digra2013/) in Atlanta, GA.
It was the first Game Studies conference I have attended and it was an *incredible* learning experience.
Below are my general impressions, notes on panels I attended, and some personal notes on my experience.

###General Impressions

This was the 10th anniversary of DiGRA, and there was a considerable amount of reflection on the past, debates about the present and predictions for the future.
There was an immense amount of discipline building, or more accurately articulation of the ongoing discipline building so many are doing in different ways and different contexts.

It was a pretty incredible mixing bowl of disciplines and methods.
I saw talks coming from design, art history, literature, media studies, game studies, sociology, psychology and computer science.
Plus a few talks from game industry people that were equally interesting.
In some ways this made  it difficult to draw connections between talks, but the diversity was also invigorating and pointed me in new directions for my own research and interests.

###Notes

I definitely did not get notes from everyone I saw speak, and I apologize for when I mess up spellings of names or titles.

#####Opening Keynote, Janet Murray
I believe the title was "Ambiguity of Game Studies".

This talk was pretty exciting for me personally.
_Hamlet of the Holodeck_ was the first thing I read that showed me people were thinking deeply about video games.
I was 16, and it was a pretty life changing experience.

This was the first of many talks that were about game studies rather than games.
Murray had a few observations that resonated with me.
First, both game design and game scholarship call for "collective invention".
There are so many skills that are necessary for both, interdisciplinary cooperation is crucial.
Second, the idea of "liminal spaces".
Both that games are liminal spaces between "reality" and some sort of "magic circle" and that field formation is a liminal activity between disciplines.
I'm missing some of the subtlety of her argument, but it was compelling.

I also have the note "Man, 'game' definitions bore the hell outta me."
This is still true.

#####Jon Peterson on DnD
This talk was ruined by the weed whacker that was outside the window I was sitting near.

#####Affection Games, [Lindsay Grace](https://twitter.com/Mindtoggle)
This was a survey of "affection" web games.
Games in which the main verb was "flirt, hug, kiss, or 'make love'".
Grace surveyed a lot of these games, and had data about audience, where the games were hosted and brief design notes.

He noted that they were overwhelmingly hetero-normative and homogeneous, aka "Unicorns don't kiss fairies".
He also noted that many of the flirting games were actually shooters, where you shot glances at your target.

Really weird subset of gaming that doesn't get a lot of attention so far as I know.

#####Big Huggin, [Lindsay Grace](https://twitter.com/Mindtoggle)
Grace ended his last paper by noting that the "hug" verb was significantly rarer than any of the others.
And so we get ["Big Huggin"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNPMW5JQmZs), a game that is controlled by hugging a large stuffed bear.
This was a game Grace made, and the talk was a bit of a post-mortem discussing design issues.
He's taken the game to hospitals and doctors offices for sick children, as well as artsy game festivals.
Very cool stuff.

#####Narrative without Fiction, Stephen Guynap
"Sometimes reality is a pain in the ass."
Not sure if that's a direct quote, but that's a pretty good summary of the talk.

This was a mesmerizing demo of a 3D virtual space, which Guynap and his collaborators have used for teaching.
Guynap demonstrated some exciting tech for doing more interesting pedagogy than simulating his students all sitting in rows.

The other question he raised was "How do we edit space for interaction the way film edited time for linear narrative?"
Very challenging and compelling question.

#####Defragging E-Sports Panel
The general theme of the panel was changing what it means to be a good sport.

TL Taylor discussed the "ideal player" at the top level of the sport.
She showed the G7 Standard player contract, and focused primarily on professionalization of e-sports.

Emma Witkowski discussed "Sportspersons on the margins", or the people below the professional level who compete but are not paid for it.

Simon Ferrari talked about League of Legends, in the context of David Sirlin's [*Playing to Win*](http://www.sirlin.net/ptw/).
I really need to read that book...

Todd Harper continued on the League of Legends theme, presenting ethnographic research about the LoL Tribunal system for moderating player behavior in game.

Finally, Davin Pavlas from Riot Games, the LoL developer, talked about the subtle systems of player control they have in place.
At Riot, they begin from the assumption that almost all players are primarily good.
Most "toxic" behavior is rare, when the player might be having a bad day outside of the game.
He had a ton of interesting data on managing toxic behavior.
Riot takes a very active role in trying to reform these players, with an outright ban being the last resort.
It was interesting to get an industry perspective last.

#####Lunch Panel: "10 Years of Game Studies"
Even more "disciplinary" concerns.

I took no specific notes (I was eating lunch) but wrote this comment:
"One of the things I like about academic game studies _is_ this interdisciplinary culture, where I can read stuff from many different perspectives.
Also frustrating, as there are no super clear standards/guidelines for research."

#####Well Played Panel
This panel was close readings of games, from the [Well Played](http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/wellplayed) journal.

Andy Nealen did a live play of Ascension, an iOS version of a board game.
It seemed like a deeper, more complex version of Dominion.
The live play got pretty silly, as most people in the room seemed to be friends, but the game definitely got onto my "To buy" list.

Missed the name, but there was a close reading of the Lord of the Rings Lego game.
Arguing it was the best of the Lego games and unpacking why (But I don't have notes on why...oops)

Really good talk about Transmedia and Myth, in the context of Batman: Arkham Asylum.
Looking at the layers of myth, brand, cannon and how they're managed.
I'm not very interested in transmedia stuff, but it was a good talk.

I stayed in this panel for two sessions because it was so good.

Next session was Brendan Keogh on Spec Ops.
Much of the talk was from his book, which I read (most of).
I still have to say I thought the game wasn't very good, but his reading of it was well done.

And perhaps my favorite talk of the conference, [Andrew Ferguson](https://twitter.com/epiktistes) on glitching Final Fantasy VI.
Really incredible look at the material and technological constraints that the FF6 programmers had to deal with, without looking at the code.
By exploiting certain glitches, he demonstrated shortcuts and assumptions that the programmers made.
Really fantastic and exciting work.

#####Procedurality, Play and Game Studies Panel
This was the big one.
Bogost, Mateas and Sicart (and Consalvo, but she was more moderating), in the teeniest room at the conference.
It was standing room only and it seemed like people were ready for a prize fight more than an academic discussion.
Sadly, they opened the panel by stating there'd be no blood.

The panel was a wrapup of discussion that began with Sicart's ["Against Procedurality."](http://gamestudies.org/1103/articles/sicart_ap)
I didn't take detailed notes (I barely had room to breathe, much less write. Plus there was a furious twitter backchannel to follow.)

Basically both sides conceded that the extreme characterizations of each other were silly and they both had something to bring to the table.
Or at least that's what I got out of it.
I'm sure people more familiar with the debate and the people involved would have a different perspective.
Pretty cool to be there for it though, lots of good points made that I really wish I'd written down.

###Personal Reflections
I attended more panels, but my notes got more and more sparse as the week continued.

The conference was a little overwhelming honestly.
I wasn't coming from a department, and didn't know *anyone*.
Networking is hard, and its even harder when you start as a lone node.
This convinced me that participating more in the online discussions around games is critical for me to get the most out of the offline experiences.

I had mixed feelings about all of the anniversary discussions.
On the one hand, the birth of a new discipline is fascinating to observe, and on the other it is maddening to be part of.
I understand at some level the importance of these fights.
Funding, impact, and tenure are all words that I'm becoming increasingly aware of and concerned about, but they also seem distant from my life as a first year grad student.
I just find it hard to get too worked up about some of these definitional debates.
That's one reason I like the term "playable media" to describe what I am interested in.
It neatly sidesteps some of the more wearisome arguments that take place in academic game studies.

Finally, my presentation went better than I could have ever guessed.
I was scheduled opposite Molleindustria, so I presented to a packed room of 5 people.
Frankly, I kinda wanted to skip my talk and watch his.
Glad I didn't, because the response I got from the small group was very encouraging and enthusiastic.
I'll be posting some version of my talk soon, and hope to continue the research in some form or scope.
